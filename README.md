Project Title: PolyProLang - A new way to contain codes
Project Description:

In a rapidly evolving technology landscape, the ability to solve problems using various programming languages is a valuable skill. PolyProLang project aims to provide a platform for developers and problem solvers to create, store, and execute algorithm implementations in multiple programming languages, all within a unified ".prolang" file format. This project serves several key purposes:

1. Diverse Language Solutions: The project encourages the use of different programming languages to solve common problems. ".prolang" files serve as containers for these diverse solutions, making it easy to compare and contrast various language implementations.

2. Educational Resource: For students and educators, this project offers a rich educational resource. It allows learners to explore how the same algorithm or problem-solving approach can be expressed in different languages, promoting a deeper understanding of programming concepts.

3. Code Sharing and Collaboration: Developers often work in teams with members who have expertise in different programming languages. The ".prolang" format facilitates code sharing and collaboration, enabling team members to contribute in their preferred languages while maintaining a unified project repository.

4. Research and Experimentation: Researchers and experimenters can leverage this project to explore the performance and behavior of algorithms in different programming languages, helping them make informed decisions on language selection for specific tasks.

Project Components:

1. ".prolang" File Format: This project introduces the ".prolang" file format, designed to store multiple implementations of algorithms or problem solutions in various programming languages. Each ".prolang" file contains code segments for the same problem in different languages, along with metadata.

2. Multi-Language Code Executor: A program has been developed to read ".prolang" files and execute the code in the specified languages. Users can choose the language of execution and observe the outcomes of the solutions.

3. Collaboration and Sharing: The project fosters a community where users can create and share ".prolang" files, contributing to a growing repository of multi-language solutions.

4. Documentation and Tutorials: To support learners and users, the project provides documentation and tutorials on how to create and work with ".prolang" files, fostering an inclusive learning environment.
